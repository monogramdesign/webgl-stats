# Monogram UI - Next.js Edition

_The Monogram client boilerplate._

## Setup.

> `next-ui` is a GitHub template repository. That means you can use this as a template to create new repositories (without losing your baggage).

1. Create a new repository using GitHub (click the + and New Repository)
2. Select `next-ui` as the template to create it from
3. Type a shortened, lowercase, kebab-case repository name for your new repository. For example, "Sample Company" could be called `sample-co`. Use this everywhere.

### Package Settings

Update _(at least)_ these fields in `package.json`:

- `name` _(e.g. `sample-co`)_
- `description`
- `repository`
- `bugs`
- `contributors`

## Install.

- `cd` to this directory and run `yarn install`

## Develop.

1. Run `yarn dev`
2. Visit the dev server at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

### HTML

1. Write good HTML
2. Don't repeat code
3. Never forget SEO & accessiblity

> You will need advanced knowledge of React and Next.js to find your way around the source. While we will improve this documentation over time, in the meantime refer to [Next.js's documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

### CSS

1. Edit `tailwind.config.js` for variables
2. Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for as many styles as possible
3. Write custom styles in `global.scss`, preferably using the [`@layer`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-css-and-layer) syntax

## Deploy & Host on Vercel

Import project in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new).
